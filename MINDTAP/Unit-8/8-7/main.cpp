Programming Exercise 8-7

Instructions

Write a program that allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates 
in a local election and the number of votes received by each candidate. The 
program should then output each candidateâ€™s name (Candidate), the number of 
votes received (Votes Received), and the percentage of the total votes received 
by the candidate (% of Total Votes). Your program should also output the winner 
of the election.

Your program must contain at least the following functions:

a function to determine the sum of votes.
a function to output the winner of the election.
A sample output is:

Candidate	Votes Received	% of Total Votes
Johnson	5000	25.91
Miller	4000	20.73
Duffy	6000	31.09
...	...	...
Total Votes:	19300
The Winner of the Election is Duffy
