Author: Cosmin Iancu

Instructions
In a right triangle, the square of the length of one side is equal to the sum 
of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a 
triangle and then outputs a message indicating whether the triangle is a right 
triangle.

If the triangle is a right triangle, output It is a right angled triangle

If the triangle is not a right triangle, output It is not a right angled 
triangle
