Programming Exercise 2-13
Author: Cosmin Iancu

Instructions
To make a profit, a local store marks up the prices of its items by a certain
percentage.

Write a C++ program that reads:

1. The original price of the item sold
2. The percentage of the marked-up price
3. The sales tax rate.

The program then outputs:

1. The original price of the item
2. The percentage of the mark-up
3. The storeâ€™s selling price of the item
4. The sales tax rate
5. The sales tax
6. The final price of the item.
   - (The final price of the item is the selling price plus the sales tax.)

Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can
store decimals.
