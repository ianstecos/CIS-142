Programming Exercise 2-15
Author: Cosmin Iancu

Instructions
Write a program to implement and test the algorithm that you designed for
Exercise 15 of Chapter 1. The instructions to Exercise 15 have been posted
below for your convenience:

Exercise 15
Given the radius, in inches, and price of a pizza, design an algorithm to find
the price of the pizza per square inch.

You may assume that the value of Ï€ = 3.141593.

In your program, declare a named constant PI to store this value.

Below is an example of how the completed program should work:

Enter the radius of the pizza: 20

Enter the price of the pizza: 22

The price per square inch is: 0.017507

Since your program handles currency, make sure to use a data type that can
store decimals.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    const double PI = 3.141593;
    double radius, price, area;

    cout << "Enter the radius of the pizza: ";
    cin >> radius;

    cout << "Enter the price of the pizza: ";
    cin >> price;

    area = PI * radius * radius;

    cout << "The price per square inch is: " << price / area << endl;

    return 0;
}
